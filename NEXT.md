# What to do next

Updated 2026-09-10 after the v0.6.0 release. This is the short operational list;
`PLAN.md` holds the broader roadmap and `LOOSE_ENDS.md` the forensic notes.
Fresh-start handoff: [`FRESH_START.md`](FRESH_START.md).

## Released baseline

[v0.6.0](https://github.com/bradleyd/worksmith/releases/tag/v0.6.0) is published
from `main` at `8220028`. Both macOS ARM64 and Linux x86-64 release assets are
available. The Homebrew tap is updated and pushed at `d93e1d9`.

Shipped work includes:

- M9 metrics: request-time model/cost/cache records, per-turn history, context
  attribution, helper spend, durable worker links, `/stats`, and offline reports.
- Command overlays and interactive skill management shared with the existing
  skill loader; workers inherit independent loaded-skill snapshots.
- Parent-only stdio MCP with trust/approval gates, bounded discovery and results,
  and recoverable oversized results. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md).
- The first M11 slice: clean-commit detached worker worktrees, retained results,
  guarded apply/discard, and recovery. See [`docs/worktrees.md`](docs/worktrees.md).
- Shared human-facing worker results with validation evidence, retained logs,
  and readable diffs across the frontends.
- Dated JSONL sessions under `YYYY/MM/DD/<id>/`, grouped supporting files,
  shared ID lookup, and ripgrep search with UTC date/range and project filters.
  Legacy flat sessions remain readable in place. See [`docs/sessions.md`](docs/sessions.md).

Release verification: 500 tests passed, two live probes ignored;
`cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed. Local build/version
verification and both GitHub release jobs passed. Earlier CLI/REPL/TUI smoke
checks covered dated sessions, search, worker metrics, and validation output.
These are release results, not claims of new validation for this Markdown refresh.

## Next: M12 per-role model routing

The initial MCP, isolation, metrics, and session-storage work has shipped.
The next recommended implementation slice is explicit routing for existing
helper calls: compaction, memory extraction/classification, and fan-out planning.

Keep it mechanical: call-site role → configured model profile → existing
`client_for` path. Reuse `[models]` and preserve existing behavior when a role is
not configured. Keep current main/worker model controls compatible.

Before production edits, inspect the actual call sites and resolve the differing
role names in older roadmap examples. Use one small configuration vocabulary;
those examples are proposals, not an implemented configuration contract.

Acceptance criteria for the first slice:

- Each configured helper uses its selected model; unspecified roles retain their
  current model selection.
- Invalid configuration produces a clear error rather than silently selecting a
  different model.
- Existing accounting records the actual helper model and attributes spend to
  the originating session.
- Scripted offline tests cover routing, fallback, and accounting. CLI and TUI
  share the backend behavior.

Do not add automatic task classification, capability discovery, a new observer,
worker MCP, or a broad TUI refactor to this slice. Add synthesis/judge routing
later if the inspected call sites justify it. Load the idiomatic Rust skill
before Rust work; keep the implementation simple and focused.

## Deferred work and constraints

- **OS sandboxing:** tracked in [issue #2](https://github.com/bradleyd/worksmith/issues/2).
  Worktrees isolate edits for review; they do not restrict process authority.
  MCP remains use-at-your-own-risk. Approval gates are not a sandbox.
- **Worker integration:** worker MCP, dirty snapshots, non-Git copies, and
  automatic merging remain deferred. Isolated spawn requires a clean checkout;
  `--shared` is an explicit alternative. Spawning is user initiated.
- **Session retention:** pruning and automatic retention need a separate design.
  No silent deletion, legacy migration, or SQLite session index is enabled.
- **Prompt/cache changes:** production memory placement stays unchanged. The
  prior experiments did not establish a consistent latency or completed-task
  quality benefit. The next gate is completed tool-loop fixtures with observed
  or fixed provider routing, then cross-turn/compaction/resume coverage if
  placement moves. See [`docs/content/guide/prompt-cache-results.md`](docs/content/guide/prompt-cache-results.md).
  Do not repeat live experiments as setup work.
- **Metrics:** missing/partial usage remains unpriced. Historical sessions cannot
  recover missing prices or worker links; cache-discount billing remains deferred.
- **TUI extraction:** continue only when a feature forces it. Preserve ordering
  around worker completion, synthesis, approvals, checkpoints, mining, compaction,
  and turn completion.

## Validation habit

Use scripted models and isolated test homes. Run `cargo test` and warning-clean
Clippy for implementation changes, plus meaningful PTY checks for affected UI.
Test the test: deliberately break the behavior a new guard claims to verify and
confirm it fails. Tool success or a vacuous validation is not proof of completion.
